# üß¨ N-Queen Problem using Genetic Algorithm

This project implements a **Genetic Algorithm** to solve the **N-Queen Problem** ‚Äî a classic combinatorial problem where the goal is to place `N` queens on an `N√óN` chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.

---

## üß† Problem Statement

Place `N` queens on a chessboard of size `N x N` so that:

- No two queens are in the same row
- No two queens are in the same column
- No two queens are on the same diagonal

Traditional backtracking solutions work, but become inefficient for larger `N`. This project uses a **Genetic Algorithm** approach for better scalability.

## üöÄ Features

- Adjustable `N` for different board sizes
- Fitness-based selection using roulette wheel
- Crossover and mutation operators
- Chessboard output visualization
- Simple and customizable code

## üß¨ Genetic Algorithm Overview

| Step           | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Encoding**   | Each individual is a list of integers; index = column, value = row of queen |
| **Fitness**    | Measures number of non-attacking queen pairs                                |
| **Selection**  | Roulette wheel based on fitness                                              |
| **Crossover**  | Single-point crossover between two parents                                   |
| **Mutation**   | Randomly alters a queen‚Äôs position with a low probability                   |
