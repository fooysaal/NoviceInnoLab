# AI Learning (Python)

This repository is a personal project to track my learning journey in **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** using **Python**. The repository is organized into various subfolders, each dedicated to a specific topic or concept that I am learning.

## Topics I am Learning

- [**Machine Learning**](./Machine-Learning): Exploring the basics of supervised and unsupervised learning, algorithms, and model evaluation.
- [**Deep Learning**](./Deep-Learning): Studying neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, and building deep learning models.
- [**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**](./NLP): Working with text data, sentiment analysis, and other NLP techniques.
- [**Reinforcement Learning**](./Reinforcement-Learning): Learning about Q-learning, policy gradients, and reinforcement learning algorithms.
- [**AI Ethics**](./AI-Ethics): Understanding ethical issues, bias, and fairness in AI.

## Repository Structure


Each subfolder contains the following:

- **Code**: Python scripts and implementations.
