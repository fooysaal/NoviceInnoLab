# Python Tools

This folder contains Python scripts for various tasks that focus on fundamental data structures, libraries, and tools in Python. The tasks cover topics such as lists, sets, tuples, dictionaries, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## Tasks Included

1. **List**: Given a list of numbers, remove duplicates and sort in ascending order.
2. **Set**: Find the common elements between two lists using sets.
3. **Tuple**: Create a tuple of student records (name, age, grade) and sort by grade.
4. **Dictionary**: Count word occurrences in a given text and store them in a dictionary.
5. **NumPy#1**: Generate a 5x5 matrix of random integers and compute row-wise sums.
6. **NumPy#2**: Create an array of 100 random values and normalize them between 0 and 1.
7. **Pandas#1**: Load a CSV file of sales data and compute total revenue per product.
8. **Pandas#2**: Fill missing values in a dataset with column-wise means.
9. **Matplotlib#1**: Plot a line graph showing temperature variations over a week.
10. **Matplotlib#2**: Create a bar chart comparing sales revenue across different regions.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository or navigate to this folder.
2. You can open and run the Python scripts in this folder to experiment with each task.
3. For any data-related tasks (e.g., Pandas#1), make sure to have the necessary dataset in place.

## Dependencies

Ensure that you have the following Python libraries installed to run the scripts:

- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations.

To install the required libraries, run:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```
